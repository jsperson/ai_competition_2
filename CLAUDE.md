## üìÅ Repository Contents

### Data Directory (`/data/`)
Contains 27 encoded text files with various unusual filenames:
- `1238TERs.txt`, `AHS3jfd.txt`, `ASDUwe8wr.txt`, `sd92j342.txt`, etc.
- Each file contains encoded data that needs to be decoded to reveal the hidden message

### Decoder Scripts

- **`decode_punchcards.py`** - Primary decoder for IBM punchcard format
- **`decode_alternative.py`** - Alternative decoding strategies
- **`decode_utf8.py`** - UTF-8 based decoding approach
- **`analyze_filenames.py`** - Analyzes file naming patterns for clues

### Prompts Directory (`/prompts/`)

- **`punchcard_decoder.md`** - Master prompt and decoding strategies

---

## üîç Methodology

The challenge required:

1. **Pattern Recognition** - Identifying the encoding format (IBM punchcard format)
2. **Rapid Analysis** - Quickly analyzing multiple files to find patterns
3. **Decoding Strategy** - Implementing multiple decoding approaches in parallel
4. **Time Pressure** - Racing against the clock to solve the riddle

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Running the Decoders

```bash
# Primary punchcard decoder
python decode_punchcards.py

# Alternative decoding methods
python decode_alternative.py

# UTF-8 decoding approach
python decode_utf8.py

# Analyze filename patterns
python analyze_filenames.py
```
